## <Feature> added to DT-UI
**Description of Previous Approach**
This is what we used to do; i.e., use fonts on USAS and Broker as static assets, declaring the rules multiple times.

**Description of New Approach**
This is what we will do now; i.e., now we will declare our font rules and families in dt-ui.

**Benefits of New Approach**
This is why we took the effort to do this; i.e., duplicate code removed between broker / USAS, fosters greater consistency of styles.
